# Face-Detection
In this code I'm trying to make a face detection algorithm, using opencv recourses and methods, for an implementation on a raspberry pi.
This algorithm could and will be used for a tracking and detection of user status : 
-driver in the case of a sleepiness detector in a smart car
-a follow me algorithm for an automatic quadrirotor (selfie drone)  
-a remote control system interpreting eye movements for paraplegic patients
